# Bus-Tracker

# Link: https://dukeofnowhere.github.io/Portfolio/Projects.html

## Description
This program uses an Api's along with real bus-stop coordinates to establish a route. A marker has been chosem and assigned bus-stop coordinates to move along with. 

## How to Run
Click the link above. It will take you to the "Projects" page. Click "Run Code" on the "Real Time Bus Tracker" Project. When the page has loaded, you will see a button on the top left of the screen saying "Show Stops Between MIT and Harvard." 
Click the button and watch the Marker move through the bus-stop coordinates along the bus route from MIT to the Harvard Campus. 

## Roadmap
Eventually I would like to create a more accurate and true reading of seat availability on Buses. It would be an multi-API application that could be accessed by the general public, but also run and dependent upon user data to constantly update seat availability stats.
